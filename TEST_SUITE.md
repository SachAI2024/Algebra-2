# Test Suite - Algebra 2 AI Tutor

## Test Coverage Report

### Critical Features Tested

## 1. API Key Configuration (FIXED)

**Issue Found:** Save Configuration button not working due to missing DOMContentLoaded wrapper

**Tests:**
- ✅ API key save to localStorage
- ✅ API key load from localStorage
- ✅ API key validation (hf_ prefix warning)
- ✅ Save confirmation message display
- ✅ Error handling for empty key

**Test File:** `/test-upload.html`

**How to Test:**
1. Open `test-upload.html` in browser
2. Run "Full Integration Test"
3. All tests should pass

**Manual Test:**
1. Open `upload.html`
2. Enter API key (e.g., `hf_test123`)
3. Click "Save Configuration"
4. Should see "✓ Configuration saved successfully!"
5. Refresh page
6. API key should still be there

**Code Coverage:**
- `upload.html`: DOMContentLoaded wrapper, error handling, validation
- `ai-service.js`: setAPIKey(), getAPIKey() methods
- localStorage integration

## 2. PDF Upload & Processing

**Tests:**
- ⚠️ PDF upload UI interaction
- ⚠️ PDF.js integration
- ⚠️ Text extraction
- ⚠️ Image extraction
- ⚠️ Chunking algorithm
- ⚠️ Progress indication

**Test File:** Manual testing required

**How to Test:**
1. Open `upload.html`
2. Upload a small PDF (3-5 pages)
3. Watch console logs for:
   - "Uploading PDF..."
   - "Extracting content..."
   - "Generating embeddings..."
   - "Saving to database..."
4. Check "Uploaded Modules" list

**Expected Results:**
- Progress bar shows 0→10→30→50→90→100%
- Status messages update correctly
- Module appears in list with chunk count
- No errors in console

---

## 3. RAG Engine

**Tests:**
- ⚠️ Text chunking (800 chars, 100 overlap)
- ⚠️ Embedding generation
- ⚠️ Cosine similarity search
- ⚠️ Context retrieval
- ⚠️ Math content detection

**Test Commands:**
```javascript
// In browser console after uploading a PDF

// Test chunking
const text = "Your long text here...";
const chunks = pdfProcessor.chunkText(text, {maxChunkSize: 800, overlap: 100});
console.log('Chunks:', chunks.length);

// Test math detection
const mathScore = pdfProcessor.identifyMathContent("Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7");
console.log('Math score:', mathScore);

// Test retrieval
const results = await ragEngine.retrieveRelevantChunks("polynomial factoring", {topK: 3});
console.log('Retrieved chunks:', results);
```

---

## 4. AI Question Generation

**Tests:**
- ⚠️ HuggingFace API connection
- ⚠️ Question formatting
- ⚠️ Multiple choice options (4 options)
- ⚠️ Correct answer marking
- ⚠️ Solution generation
- ⚠️ Retry logic on 503 errors

**Test Commands:**
```javascript
// In browser console

// Test question generation
const question = await aiService.generateQuestion(
  "A polynomial is an expression with variables and coefficients",
  2,
  "polynomials"
);
console.log('Generated question:', question);

// Verify structure
console.assert(question.question, "Question text exists");
console.assert(question.options.length === 4, "Has 4 options");
console.assert(question.correctIndex >= 0 && question.correctIndex < 4, "Valid correct index");
console.assert(question.solution, "Has solution");
```

---

## 5. Session Management

**Tests:**
- ✅ Session initialization with DOMContentLoaded
- ⚠️ Timer countdown (20 min)
- ⚠️ Question progression
- ⚠️ Difficulty adaptation (2-3 correct → level up)
- ⚠️ 3-attempt system
- ⚠️ Streak tracking
- ⚠️ Performance analytics

**Manual Test:**
1. Open `session.html`
2. Select a module
3. Start session
4. Answer questions:
   - Get 2-3 correct quickly → difficulty should increase
   - Get 3 wrong → see explanation + practice problems
5. Complete session → see report

**Expected Behavior:**
- Timer counts down from 20:00
- Difficulty badge updates (1→2→3→4)
- Streak counter tracks consecutive correct answers
- After 3 wrong attempts: explanation + 4 practice problems
- Final report shows: accuracy, timing, slow questions, recommendations

---

## 6. Firebase Integration

**Tests:**
- ⚠️ Firebase initialization
- ⚠️ Firestore read/write
- ⚠️ Storage upload
- ⚠️ LocalStorage fallback
- ⚠️ Error handling

**Test Commands:**
```javascript
// Check Firebase status
console.log('Firebase initialized:', firebaseService.initialized);
console.log('Using fallback:', firebaseService.useFallback);

// Test Firestore
await firebaseService.saveContent('test-module', {data: 'test'});
const retrieved = await firebaseService.getContent('test-module');
console.log('Retrieved:', retrieved);
```

---

## 7. Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm

**Tests:**
- ⚠️ Level up on streak (2-3 correct)
- ⚠️ Level down on failure
- ⚠️ Fast answer bonus (< 45s)
- ⚠️ Difficulty bounds (1-4)
- ⚠️ Streak reset after level change

**Test Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Input | Expected Output |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 2 correct, fast (< 45s) | streak=2, time=30s | difficulty +1, streak=0 |
| 3 wrong attempts | attempts=0 | difficulty -1, show explanation |
| At max difficulty (4) | correct, streak=2 | stay at 4, don't overflow |
| At min difficulty (1) | 3 wrong | stay at 1, don't go below |

---

## 8. Error Handling

**Tests:**
- ✅ Missing API key
- ✅ Invalid API key format
- ⚠️ Network errors
- ⚠️ 503 model loading
- ⚠️ Parse errors
- ⚠️ Empty PDF
- ⚠️ Encrypted PDF

**Test Cases:**
1. **No API key:** Should redirect to upload page with alert
2. **Invalid key:** Should show warning if doesn't start with `hf_`
3. **Network error:** Should retry 3 times, then show error
4. **Model loading (503):** Should wait and retry automatically
5. **Parse error:** Should fall back to default question
6. **Empty PDF:** Should show "No suitable content found"
