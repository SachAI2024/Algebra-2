# Project Summary: AI-Powered Algebra 2 Tutor

## What Was Built

I've transformed your static Algebra 2 tutor into a comprehensive **RAG-based adaptive learning platform** with AI-powered question generation and personalized feedback.

## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### 1. RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
✅ **PDF Upload & Processing**
- Drag-and-drop interface for uploading textbook PDFs
- Extracts text and images using PDF.js
- Chunks content into 800-character segments with 100-char overlap
- Identifies math-rich content automatically

✅ **Vector Embeddings**
- Generates embeddings using HuggingFace Sentence Transformers
- Stores vectors for semantic search
- Cosine similarity for relevant content retrieval

✅ **AI Question Generation**
- Uses Qwen-Math (HuggingFace) to create questions from textbook content
- Contextual questions based on uploaded curriculum
- Multiple-choice format with 4 options
- Includes step-by-step solutions

### 2. Adaptive Learning Algorithm
✅ **Difficulty Adaptation**
- Starts at level 1, adjusts based on performance
- Get 2-3 correct in a row + fast → difficulty increases
- Fail 3 attempts → difficulty decreases
- Tracks streak and adjusts in real-time

✅ **Timed Sessions**
- 20-minute default (customizable 10-30 min)
- 7-10 questions per session
- Live timer with visual countdown
- Time tracking per question for analytics

✅ **3-Attempt System**
- 3 chances per question
- After 3rd failure:
  - AI-generated explanation of mistake
  - Detailed solution walkthrough
  - 3-4 auto-generated practice problems
  - Teaches the concept before moving on

### 3. Performance Analytics
✅ **Session Reports**
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Time per question breakdown
- Difficulty progression chart
- Identification of slow questions
- Topic coverage summary

✅ **Personalized Recommendations**
- Timing improvement suggestions
- Topic-specific practice recommendations
- Difficulty adjustment advice
- Study strategy tips

### 4. Dual-Mode System
✅ **Classic Mode** (Preserved)
- Original guided lessons (6.1-6.4)
- Pre-built curriculum
- Works offline
- No setup required

✅ **AI Mode** (New)
- Dynamic content from uploaded PDFs
- Adaptive difficulty
- Cloud or local storage
- Requires API key (free)

## 📁 File Structure Created

### HTML Pages (4 new + 1 updated)
- **index.html** - Landing page with mode selection
- **upload.html** - PDF upload interface for admins/teachers
- **session.html** - AI-powered practice sessions
- **lessons.html** - Renamed from old index.html (classic mode)
- **test.html** - Preserved unit tests

### JavaScript Core (5 new files)
1. **firebase-config.js** - Cloud storage with localStorage fallback
2. **pdf-processor.js** - PDF text/image extraction, chunking
3. **ai-service.js** - HuggingFace API integration (Qwen-Math)
4. **rag-engine.js** - RAG pipeline, embeddings, retrieval
5. **session-manager.js** - Adaptive sessions, timing, analytics

### Documentation (4 comprehensive guides)

## 🔧 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+) - No frameworks
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Responsive design
- **PDF.js** - PDF parsing (via CDN)

### AI/ML
- **HuggingFace Inference API**
  - Qwen-Math: Question generation & explanations
  - Sentence Transformers: Embeddings
- **RAG Architecture**: Chunking → Embedding → Retrieval → Generation

### Backend
- **Firebase** (optional)
  - Firestore: Store modules & sessions
  - Storage: Store PDF files
- **LocalStorage**: Fallback for offline use

### Deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Static hosting (100% free)
- **CDN**: All external dependencies
- **No Build Tools**: Direct deployment

## 🚀 How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
Teacher uploads PDF
    ↓
PDF.js extracts text + images
    ↓
Content chunked (800 chars)
    ↓
HuggingFace generates embeddings
    ↓
Store in Firebase/localStorage
    ↓
Ready for question generation
```

### Session Flow
```
Student starts session (20 min, 10 questions)
    ↓
RAG retrieves relevant chunks (cosine similarity)
    ↓
Qwen-Math generates question from context
    ↓
Student answers (3 attempts)
    ↓
    ├─ Correct → Increase difficulty (if streak)
    └─ Wrong → Show explanation + practice
    ↓
Track timing, difficulty, accuracy
    ↓
Generate personalized report
```

### Adaptive Algorithm
```javascript
// Increase difficulty
if (streak >= 2 && timeSpent < 45s) {
  difficulty = min(4, difficulty + 1)
  streak = 0
}

// Decrease difficulty
if (attempts === 0) {
  difficulty = max(1, difficulty - 1)
  showExplanation()
  generatePracticeProblems(4)
}
```

## 💰 Cost Structure

All services have free tiers suitable for classroom use:

| Service | Free Tier | Paid (if needed) |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
