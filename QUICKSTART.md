## Testing Your Setup

### Test Classic Mode
1. Visit `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/algebra2-tutor/lessons.html`
2. Should see 4 modules
3. Click through a few steps
4. Verify progress saves

### Test AI Mode
1. Visit `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/algebra2-tutor/session.html`
2. Select your uploaded module
3. Click "Start Session"
4. Answer a few questions
5. Check if difficulty adapts

### Test Upload

2. Upload a small PDF (3-5 pages)
3. Check processing completes
4. Verify in "Uploaded Modules" list

## Troubleshooting

### "No modules available"
**Problem**: No PDFs uploaded yet
**Solution**: Go to upload page and upload a PDF chapter

### "API key not set"
**Problem**: HuggingFace key not configured
**Solution**: Visit upload page, enter key, click save

### "Model is loading"
**Problem**: Cold start on HuggingFace (normal)
**Solution**: Wait 20-30 seconds, it will auto-retry

### Upload stuck
**Problem**: PDF too large or encrypted
**Solution**: Try smaller PDF (under 50MB), ensure not password-protected

### Questions not generating
**Problem**: PDF has no text (scanned images only)
**Solution**: Use OCR on PDF first, or upload text-based PDF
