## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Students

1. **Visit the Website**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/algebra2-tutor/`
2. **Choose Your Mode**:
   - **AI Practice** → Upload content, start adaptive sessions
   - **Guided Lessons** → Pre-built curriculum, start immediately
3. **Start Learning!**

### For Admins/Teachers

1. **Setup** (5 minutes):
   - Get free HuggingFace API key
   - Configure Firebase (optional, for cloud storage)
   - See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed instructions

2. **Upload Content**:
   - Go to `upload.html`
   - Enter API key
   - Upload PDF textbook chapters
   - Wait for processing (2-5 min per chapter)

3. **Share with Students**:
   - Students access via GitHub Pages URL
   - No login required (optional Firebase auth)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **AI/ML**:
  - HuggingFace Inference API (Qwen-Math for questions)
  - Sentence Transformers (embeddings)
- **PDF Processing**: PDF.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore + Storage)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (100% static, no build tools!)

## 🎯 How It Works

### RAG System Architecture

1. **PDF Upload** → Extract text + images using PDF.js
2. **Chunking** → Split content into ~800 character chunks with overlap
3. **Embeddings** → Generate vector embeddings via HuggingFace
4. **Storage** → Save chunks + embeddings to Firebase/localStorage
5. **Retrieval** → Find relevant chunks using cosine similarity
6. **Generation** → Use Qwen-Math to generate questions from context
7. **Adaptation** → Adjust difficulty based on student performance

### Adaptive Algorithm

```
If student gets 2-3 correct in a row (and fast):
  → Increase difficulty level

If student fails 3 attempts:
  → Show detailed explanation (AI-generated)
  → Provide 3-4 practice problems
  → Decrease difficulty level
  → Reset streak
```

## 🧪 Development

### Run Locally

```bash
# Option 1: Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Option 3: VS Code Live Server
# Install "Live Server" extension
# Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`

### Run Tests

Open `test.html` in browser to see unit test results.

### Add New Lessons

Edit `js/lessons.js` to add modules:

```javascript
{
  id: "new-topic",
  tag: "6.5",
  title: "New Topic",
  sub: "Description",
  steps: [
    () => stepInfo(`<div>Content...</div>`),
    () => stepInput("Question", "placeholder", validatorFn, "hint")
  ]
}
```

## 🎓 Educational Philosophy

1. **Adaptive Learning**: Students work at their own pace and level
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Know if you're right or wrong instantly
3. **Conceptual Understanding**: Explanations focus on "why", not just "what"
4. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Automatic generation of similar problems
5. **Time Management**: Learn to solve problems efficiently
6. **Self-Paced**: No pressure, learn when you're ready

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local-First**: Progress stored in browser localStorage
- **Optional Cloud**: Firebase for multi-device sync
- **API Keys**: Stored locally, never transmitted except to HuggingFace
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no cookies, no data collection
- **Open Source**: Fully auditable code

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-subject support (Algebra 1, Geometry, Pre-Calc)
- [ ] Teacher dashboard with student analytics
- [ ] Collaborative learning (share questions)
- [ ] Voice input for math problems
- [ ] Mobile app (PWA)
